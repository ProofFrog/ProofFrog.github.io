# CAPS 2025 Tutorial

ProofFrog was one of the examples presented at the [Workshop on Computer-Aided Proofs of Security (CAPS)](https://caps-workshop.com/) at Eurocrypt 2025.

The [presentation](assets/caps-2025-presentation-prooffrog.pdf) walked through the pen-and-paper proof that the KEM-DEM construction is IND-CPA-secure, then showed the analogous proof in ProofFrog.

A tutorial file walking through the pen-and-paper and ProofFrog proofs side-by-side, as well as executable ProofFrog files, can be found in the [proof-ladders asymmetric ladder repository on Github](https://github.com/proof-ladders/asymmetric-ladder/tree/main/kemdem/ProofFrog).
