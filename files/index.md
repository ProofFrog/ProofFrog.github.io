ProofFrog has four types of files: [Primitive Files]({% link files/primitive.md %}), [Scheme Files]({% link files/scheme.md %}), [Game Files]({% link files/game.md %}) and [Proof Files]({% link files/proof.md %}).

Proof files are the only type of file that ProofFrog actually verifies, the remaining exist to provide definitions of security definitions and schemes to be used in proofs.

Examples for the syntax of each file can be found on the [Examples]({% link examples.md %}) page.

The full grammar for each of the file types, in ANTLR 4 syntax, can be found in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ProofFrog/ProofFrog/tree/main/proof_frog/antlr)
